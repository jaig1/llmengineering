**1. `src/llmwebscraper.ipynb`**  
This notebook demonstrates how to interact with the OpenAI API using environment variables for secure key management. It includes code for validating API keys and making a simple chat request to a GPT-4 model. The notebook also sets up the environment for web scraping and data display using libraries such as `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `IPython.display`.

**2. `src/huggingfacepipelines.ipynb`**  
This notebook provides practical examples of using Hugging Face pipelines for various NLP tasks. It covers installing required dependencies, authenticating with the Hugging Face Hub, and running pipelines for sentiment analysis and named entity recognition. The notebook is designed for hands-on experimentation with state-of-the-art transformer models.
